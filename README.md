# Treasure Hub
  Treasure Hub is a UNIX-based C program developed as part of an Operating Systems course project. It simulates a treasure hunting coordination system, enabling multiple processes to interact using file operations, signals, and pipes. The system is divided into modular components with clearly defined responsibilities.
